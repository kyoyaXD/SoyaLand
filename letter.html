            as i am typing this. anyways i hope everything<br/>
            is well at your home as well, your parents, sister, dadi,<br/>
            i hope theyre all good. i was free at home and i <br/>
            wanted to do something that would make you happy,<br/>
            so i made this lil project hehe. i know it may not be<br/>
            the best website ever, but i built it using what limited<br/>
            knowledge i had. also i cant put any sensitive or private<br/>
            info here as when this goes live, it will be out there for<br/>
            the whole internet to see and access. anyways. i just miss<br/>
            you a lot rn and i really hope i get to see you soon, and give<br/>
            you a physical present as well. take care of your health,<br/>
            dont fall sick in this harsh weather. remember to stay hydrated!<br/>
            i just want you to know that no matter what anyone says<br/>
            or no matter who is against you, i will always support you<br/>
            and stand by you. i promise to always be there for you,<br/>
            love you, care for you, and protect you from everything.<br/>
            i will never let anything or anyone come between us.<br/>
            the distance between us is painful sometimes, but as they<br/>
            say, "the longer the wait, the sweeter the kiss". i <br/>
            believe i'll get to see you soon, and i am waiting patiently for that day.<br/><br/>

            i love you so much bbg take care of yourself okay<br/>
            love from soya mwaa &lt3
